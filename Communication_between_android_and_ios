More radical preppers don't have any smartphone at all, but simply a Private Mobile Radio (i.e. Digital Mobile Radio walkie talkie), 
or a very simple dumbphone or basic high-end cellphone (like the Light Phone 2).
For those that aren't as radical and still urbanite however, smart phones remain an option.
That said, within the latter group, there are both apple enthusiasts, and android lovers.
This distinction also makes that both have their own smartphones (either Iphone or Android phone), and the 
smart (android) prepper will still want to be able to communicate with apple preppers and vice versa.
So to achieve this, here are the apps you can install (or are standard in the OS) which will work on both:

Main apps:
Phone: for analog calling to any phone, including landlines and dumbphones
Signal: for digital calling (so only to smartphones) + chatting + videocalling
iMessage / (Android) Messages: for SMS/MMS
iMail / Gmail or Email: for e-mail

Additional apps:
Life360 or GeoZilla: tracking the family
Maps.me: offline maps
Google Earth
TripAdvisor
Compass
Calendar
Notes
Weather
CNN
Google Photos / Apple Photos
Google Drive (iOS has iDrive)
Google Translate
instashare or SHAREit (for offline file sharing between 2 phones, over same WiFi network)
Reminders / Google Tasks 
Apple or Google Wallet
Fing
Contacts
Star Chart
Podcasts
LeafSnap
Plantix (Android only)
Books
Music
TV
Ada

For settings:
Most preppers will want to go cheap, so using prepaid rather than using subscription.
This also has limitations however regarding data use.
To avoid these problems, set settings --> global settings --> refresh in background --> wifi only (no mobile data)
Mobile data can be set off, per program (in settings) and/or globally
Location sharing is best set to "only when I use app" rather than having it share location all the time;
can give some problems with some programs like Life360 however, same with refresh in background
