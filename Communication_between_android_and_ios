More radical preppers don't have any smartphone at all, but simply a Private Mobile Radio (i.e. Digital Mobile Radio walkie talkie), 
or a very simple dumbphone or basic high-end cellphone (like the Light Phone 2).
For those that aren't as radical and still urbanite however, smart phones remain an option.
That said, within the latter group, there are both apple enthusiasts, and android lovers.
This distinction also makes that both have their own smartphones (either Iphone or Android phone), and the 
smart (android) prepper will still want to be able to communicate with apple preppers and vice versa.
So to achieve this, here are the apps you can install (or are standard in the OS) which will work on both:

Main apps:
Phone: for analog calling to any phone, including landlines and dumbphones
Signal: for digital calling (so only to smartphones) + chatting + videocalling
iMessage / (Android) Messages: for SMS/MMS
iMail / Gmail or Email: for e-mail
Life360: tracking the family
